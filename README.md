# Vector-Calculus

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the first three chapthers of the sixth edition of Vector Calculus by Jerrold E. Marsden and Anthony Tromba.  

Each exercise is written in its own `.tex` file. Files are organized into folders corresponding to their respective sections, which are in turn contained within the folder of their corresponding chapter.

Overly trivial exercises are omitted.
